Rent The Magic is a small 'AirBnB' like app, developed as a Le Wagon coding bootcamp exercise in teams of 4.

As a limited time exercise it's not meant to be a perfect production app.
However, it's been deployed on Heroku for learning purposes. You can see the 'production site' [here](http://rent-the-magic.herokuapp.com/)

It's been made with Ruby on Rails framework.

Rails app generated with [lewagon/rails-templates](https://github.com/lewagon/rails-templates), created by the [Le Wagon coding bootcamp](https://www.lewagon.com) team.
